However, these two texts can differ when post-processing of\n  the solver's response is performed. This is now fixed in the log \n  viewer (#166, #169 by @mattwarkentin).\n\n* The default `accuracy()` metric will now report a score of 0 rather than \n  `NaN` when all scores are 0.\n\n* Fixed bug where non-default grading systems in model-graded evals would\n  result in scores being wiped during logging (#139).\n\n* The full suite of package tests can now be ran without active API keys via\n  the vcr package (#163).\n\n* `$eval()` and `$log()` will now write log files to the same default \n  directory--the one specified when initializing the Task object. \n  Previously, `$eval()` wrote to that directory, while `$log()` wrote \n  to `vitals_log_dir()` (#158 by @SokolovAnatoliy).\n\n* Manifest files for deployed logs are now named `listing.json` rather than `logs.json` for compatibility with newer Inspect versions.\n\n* Removed dependency on the rstudioapi package (#146).\n\n* `$eval()` now routes arguments to solvers and scorers based on\n  their function signatures, allowing users to pass arguments specific to each\n  without requiring ellipses in both functions (#152). \n  `$eval()` now errors when supplied unnamed arguments.\n\n* Solvers and scorers can now return arbitrary R objects in metadata; they\n  will be summarized in a lossy format when logged to .json.\n\n* The package will now set the envvar `IN_VITALS_EVAL` to `\"true\"` during \n  solving and scoring.\n\n* Numeric task targets will no longer introduce errors in the log viewer.\n\n* Images, audio, and video generated from tool calls will now be logged \n  compatibly with the log viewer (#138).\n\n* Updated the vendored Inspect Log Viewer to Inspect version 0.3.122 (#138).\n\n* `detect_match()` now lists the correct `location` options in its default \n  value (#140, #142 by @mattwarkentin).\n\n* The log viewer previously reported the scorer's response as both the solver's\n  and scorers response—this is now fixed (#141, #142 by @mattwarkentin).\n```\n",
